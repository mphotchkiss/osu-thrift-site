# osu-thrift-site
A simple node website for posting items for sale - like an online thrift store for Oregon State University students

## What I Learned
- express server
- express handlebars
- simple JSON data storage
- CSS styling
- raw Javascript

## How To Use
After cloning the project, change into the project directory and
`
npm install
`

After that, all that's required is

`
npm start
`

And head on over to `localhost:3000`

From there, see the existing posts, and add new ones with the button in the bottom right. Click on the posts to toggle the details, and click again to go back to the photo view. Posts can be deleted, but only with the password with which they were created.
